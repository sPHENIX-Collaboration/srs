This is the RCDAQ plugin that teaches RCDAQ how to read out the
CERN-RD51 "Scalable Readout System" (SRS).

To install, use (assuming that you are in the build area)
../../srs/autogen.sh --prefix=$INSTALL_AREA

If your SRS crate has an IP address different from 10.0.0.2, you can
communicate this at compile time with
../../srs/autogen.sh --with-srsip=10.0.0.5 --prefix=$INSTALL_AREA

This will configure all tools to use this IP by default.

Note that you will likely want to unpack the srs_scripts.tar.gz
tarball somewhere, which has some standard scripts to initialize the
SRS and the hybrids. You should probably try the
"setup_srs_testpulse.sh" setup, which sets the hybrids up to give test
pulses. This will allow you to see if everything works ok.
